\subsection{Overview}
\hspace{\parindent}Architectural design of the application is based on the three-layer model used in most applications. The three layers are the presentation layer, or frontend, the application layer, or middleware, and the data layer, or backend. Each of those layers does its own part of the job and communicates with other layers in order to present the correct information to the user.\\
The architecture is also a typical client-server implementation where server holds the data and the client is accessing it through requests (besides the offline mode where the user stored some of the data from the server locally and is accessing it without using online requests).\\
\subsubsection{Backend architecture}
\textbf{WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE - WHICH BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION WE ARE GOING TO USE}
\subsubsection{Middleware architecture}
In order to connect the data on the server to the screen of the phone and to allow the user to properly see the data, we have implemented a complicated layer of functions and classes in order to create easy-to-use and esthetically pleasing experience for the user.
